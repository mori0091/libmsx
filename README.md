The `libmsx` library exposes MSX, MSX2, MSX2+, and MSXturboR hardware
functionality to the C programmer.

The library is intended for use with the C cross compiler
[SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/), and makes it easy to build MSX ROM
cartridge image (16KiB, 32KiB, or MegaROM).

# Pre-requisites

## Target Machine

- MSX
- MSX2
- MSX2+
- MSXturboR

## Host Platform

**Linux**

| Host Platform | SDCC version | status          |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Ubuntu 24.04  | 4.4.0        | âœ” (outdated)    |
|               | 4.5.0        | âœ” (recommended) |

**Windows**

| Host Platform | SDCC version | status          |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| MSYS2 UCRT64  | 4.4.0        | (not tested)    |
|               | 4.5.0        | (not tested)    |

Ofcourse, Ubuntu on **WSL2** is okey. ðŸ˜„  
(**WSL2**: Windows Subsystem for Linux)

## Build tools

- SDCC  
  Small Device C Compiler  
  <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/>

> SDCC 4.5.0 or later is recommended.

- Other toolchain required for libmsx  
  GNU `find`, `make`, `gcc`, `gzip`, `zcat`, `xsltproc`, and so on.


# Install instructions of Build tools

To use `libmsx`,
1. Install SDCC.
2. Install other toolchain.

## Ubuntu

### 1. Install SDCC

Download a SDCC pre-built binary for Linux from <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/>
and install it.

SDCC 4.5.0 or later is recommended.

Don't forget adding SDCC to `PATH` environment variable.  
Add the below to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.  

> At here it is assuming that the SDCC 4.5.0 is installed under `~/sdcc-4.5.0`.

```shell
export PATH=${PATH}:~/sdcc-4.5.0/bin
```

> Why don't we install sdcc by `sudo apt install sdcc` ?
> 
> Because the latest version of SDCC may not be installed by `apt`. In case of
> Ubuntu 24.04, SDCC 4.2.0 is installed. Thus we recommend that you download
> SDCC 4.5.0 pre-built binary and use it on Ubuntu 24.04 or later.

### 2. Install other toolchain

``` shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential make gcc gzip xsltproc git
```

## Windows (Ubuntu on WSL2)

The 1st case is using Ubuntu on WSL2 environment.  
In this case, it is same as for Ubuntu.

Launch a terminal of *Ubuntu on WSL2*, and proceed with the above instructions.


## Windows (MSYS2)

The 2nd case is using MSYS2 UCRT64 environment.

### 1. Install SDCC

Download a SDCC pre-built binary for Windows from <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/>
and install it.

### 2. Install other toolchain

Download and install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).

Then launch a terminal for the MSYS2 UCRT64 environment, and do as follows:
~~~ shell
pacman -S coreutils findutils make gcc gzip libxslt git
~~~

Don't forget adding SDCC to `PATH` environment variable.  
Add the below to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`, on MSYS2 UCRT64 environment.  

> At here it is assuming that the SDCC is installed under `C:\Program Files\SDCC`.

```shell
export PATH=${PATH}:/c/Program\ Files/SDCC/bin
```


# Build instructions of the library and sample projects

The below makes the library `libmsx.lib` into `lib` folder, and bundled tools
into `bin` folder.

``` shell
make
```

To build sample projects in `sample/`, do as follows:

``` shell
make sample
```

And for cleaning up:

``` shell
make clean
```


# Build instructions of user applications

> There are several sample projects, please refer to the `sample/`
> folder of the `libmsx` project.

## Preparation

**Step 1.** Make your project's Git repository.

``` shell
git init my_proj
```

**Step 2.** Download `libmsx` and place it somewhere.

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/mori0091/libmsx.git libmsx
```

**Step 3.** Copy `libmsx/mk/Makefile` to top of your repository, and
customize it.

See <https://github.com/mori0091/libmsx/blob/main/mk/Makefile>

``` shell
cp libmsx/mk/Makfile my_proj/
```

**Step 4.** Create the folder `my_proj/src/` and place your C source
files under it or in its subfolders.

``` shell
mkdir my_proj/src
```

## Build your application

To build your application, do as follows on the top of your repository `my_proj`.  
Then the ROM image will be made into `my_proj/bin` folder.

``` shell
make
```

And for cleaning up:

``` shell
make clean
```
