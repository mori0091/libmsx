The `libmsx` library exposes MSX, MSX2, MSX2+, and MSXturboR hardware
functionality to the C programmer.

The library is intended for use with the C cross compiler
[SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/), and makes it easy to build MSX ROM
cartridge image (16KiB, 32KiB, or MegaROM).

## API reference

The API reference of the `libmsx` library is hosted on GitHub Pages.  
See <https://mori0091.github.io/libmsx/index.html>

## Supported functionality

The below functionality is supported.

- Getting MSX system version code

- VSYNC based timing synchronization

- Almost of TMS9918A, V9938, V9958 VDP (Video Display Processor) functionality.
  - Display screen mode setting
  - Display area position adjustment
  - Display lines setting (192 lines / 212 lines)
  - VRAM memory map setting (pattern name table, color table, and so on)
  - Color palette
  - Hardware vertical scroll
  - Hardware horizontal scroll
  - Enable / disable display visibility
  - Enable / disable sprites visibility
  - VDP command execution (HMMM, HMMV, LMMM, and LMMV)
  - VRAM read / write
  - â€¦ and so on

- GPIO (8-bit parallel I/O port ; a.k.a Joystick I/F)
  - Reading joystick input state.

- Sound output
  - PSG (AY-3-8910)

    - AHDSR (attack / hold / decay / sustain / release) type envelope generator
    - LPCM (8-bit 60Hz linear PCM) type envelope generator
    - Up to 16 user-defined envelope patterns can be used.
  - (A MML compiler for the sound driver is not developped yet.)

- MegaROM Mapper
  - SDCC `__banked` functions support (SDCC 4.2.0 or later)
  - Supported ROM mappers:
    - ASCII8 ROM mapper
    - ASCII16 ROM mapper

## Unsupported functionality

The below functionality is NOT supported yet.

# Pre-requisites

## Target Machine

- MSX
- MSX2
- MSX2+
- MSXturboR

## Host Platform

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ubuntu 21.xx (not tested)
- Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended)

- Windows 10 / MSYS2 MINGW64 (not tested)

Ofcourse, Ubuntu on **WSL** is okey. ðŸ˜„  
(**WSL**: Windows Subsystem for Linux)

## Build tools

- SDCC  
  Small Device C Compiler  
  <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/>

> SDCC 4.2.0 or later is recommended.

â€¦ and some popular standard Linux/Unix commands:

- `find`, `make`,
- and so on.

# Install instructions of Build tools

**Ubuntu**

``` shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install sdcc
```

> Note that the latest version of SDCC may not be installed by the above
> instruction. In case of Ubuntu 22.04, SDCC 4.0.0 is installed. Thus we
> recommend that you download SDCC 4.2.0 pre-built binary and use it on Ubuntu
> 22.04 or later.

# Build instructions of the library and sample projects

The below makes the library `libmsx.lib` into `lib` directory.

``` shell
make
```

To build sample projects in `sample/`, do as follows:

``` shell
make sample
```

And for cleaning up:

``` shell
make clean
```

# Build instructions of user applications

> There are several sample projects, please refer to the `sample/`
> folder of the `libmsx` project.

## Preparation

**Step 1.** Make your project's Git repository.

``` shell
git init my_proj
```

**Step 2.** Download `libmsx` and place it somewhere.

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/mori0091/libmsx.git libmsx
```

**Step 3.** Copy `libmsx/mk/Makefile` to top of your repository, and
customize it.

See <https://github.com/mori0091/libmsx/blob/main/mk/Makefile>

``` shell
cp libmsx/mk/Makfile my_proj/
```

**Step 4.** Create the folder `my_proj/src/` and place your C source
files under it or in its subfolders.

``` shell
mkdir my_proj/src
```

## Build your application

To build your application, do as follows.  
Then the ROM image will be made into `my_proj/bin` folder.

``` shell
make
```

And for cleaning up:

``` shell
make clean
```
