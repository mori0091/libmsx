The `libmsx` library exposes MSX, MSX2, MSX2+, and MSXturboR hardware
functionality to the C programmer.

The library is intended for use with the C cross compiler
[SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/), and makes it easy to build MSX ROM
cartridge image (16KiB, 32KiB, or MegaROM).

file (.aks file) into your application.
    - See also the [design note of SNDDRV](docs/design-notes_snddrv.md)

  - Another **OLD** PSG sound driver (sound.h, sound_eg.h) is still available,
    but is no longer maintained.

- MegaROM Mapper
  - SDCC `__banked` functions support (SDCC 4.2.0 or later)
  - Supported ROM mappers:
    - ASCII8 ROM mapper
    - ASCII16 ROM mapper

- Keyboard input
- Sound output
  - ~~PSG (AY-3-8910)~~ `supported`
  - OPLL (YM2413 / MSX-MUSIC)
- ~~BGM driver~~ `supported`

# Pre-requisites

## Target Machine

- MSX
- MSX2
- MSX2+
- MSXturboR

## Host Platform

**Linux**

| Host Platform | SDCC version | status          |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Ubuntu 20.04  | 3.8.0        | ‚úî (outdated)    |
|               | 3.9.0        | (not tested)    |
|               | 4.0.0        | (not tested)    |
|               | 4.1.0        | (not tested)    |
|               | 4.2.0        | ‚ùå              |
| Ubuntu 22.04  | 4.0.0        | ‚úî (outdated)    |
|               | 4.1.0        | (not tested)    |
|               | 4.2.0        | ‚úî (recommended) |

**Windows**

| Host Platform | SDCC version | status          |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| MSYS2 MINGW64 | 4.0.0        | (not tested)    |
|               | 4.1.0        | (not tested)    |
|               | 4.2.0        | ‚úî (recommended) |

Ofcourse, Ubuntu on **WSL** is okey. üòÑ  
(**WSL**: Windows Subsystem for Linux)

## Build tools

- SDCC  
  Small Device C Compiler  
  <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/>

> SDCC 4.2.0 or later is recommended.

‚Ä¶ and some popular standard Linux/Unix commands:

- GNU `find`, `make`,
- and so on.

# Install instructions of Build tools

## Ubuntu

``` shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install sdcc
```

> Note that the latest version of SDCC may not be installed by the above
> instruction. In case of Ubuntu 22.04, SDCC 4.0.0 is installed. Thus we
> recommend that you download SDCC 4.2.0 pre-built binary and use it on Ubuntu
> 22.04 or later.

## Windows

There are two recommended ways to setup build tools:

CASE 1. Use Ubuntu on WSL environment, and proceed with the above instructions.

CASE 2. Use MSYS2 MINGW64 environment.
- Download and install [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/).
- Download and install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).  
  Then install the required build tools as described in "MSYS2 Getting Started"
  https://www.msys2.org/.

> See carefully "MSYS2 Getting Started" https://www.msys2.org/ for detail.

Finally, don't forget adding SDCC to `PATH` environment variable.  
(add the below to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`)
```shell
export PATH=${PATH}:/c/Program\ Files/SDCC/bin
```

# Build instructions of the library and sample projects

The below makes the library `libmsx.lib` into `lib` directory.

``` shell
make
```

To build sample projects in `sample/`, do as follows:

``` shell
make sample
```

And for cleaning up:

``` shell
make clean
```

# Build instructions of user applications

> There are several sample projects, please refer to the `sample/`
> folder of the `libmsx` project.

## Preparation

**Step 1.** Make your project's Git repository.

``` shell
git init my_proj
```

**Step 2.** Download `libmsx` and place it somewhere.

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/mori0091/libmsx.git libmsx
```

**Step 3.** Copy `libmsx/mk/Makefile` to top of your repository, and
customize it.

See <https://github.com/mori0091/libmsx/blob/main/mk/Makefile>

``` shell
cp libmsx/mk/Makfile my_proj/
```

**Step 4.** Create the folder `my_proj/src/` and place your C source
files under it or in its subfolders.

``` shell
mkdir my_proj/src
```

## Build your application

To build your application, do as follows.  
Then the ROM image will be made into `my_proj/bin` folder.

``` shell
make
```

And for cleaning up:

``` shell
make clean
```
