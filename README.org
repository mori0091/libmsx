** Install instructions of Build tools

*Ubuntu*
#+begin_src shell
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install build-essential
  sudo apt install sdcc
#+end_src


* Build instructions of the library and sample projects

The below makes the library ~libmsx.lib~ into ~lib~ directory.
#+begin_src shell
  make
#+end_src

TO build sample projects in ~sample/~, do as follows:
#+begin_src shell
  make sample
#+end_src

And for cleaning up:
#+begin_src shell
  make clean
#+end_src
